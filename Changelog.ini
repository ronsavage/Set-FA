- Co-maint is now with Ron Savage, who will do all future development, starting with this version.
- Rewrite Set::FA::Element to use getters/setters via Hash::FieldHash, rather than use direct
access to the underlying hash.
- Change some parameters to Set::FA::Element.new(). See docs for details:
o accept is now called accepting, since accept() is a method.
o die_on_loop is a new option.
o logger is a log object of some sort. I prefer Log::Handler. Log::Agent is not supported.
o start is a new option.
o states is not supported. The list of states in the transitions parameter is used instead.
o Add (within the code) parentheses to the regexp parameter in the transitions option, if
it's not a coderef, to support the match() method.
o verbose is a new option.
- New methods for Set::FA::Element:
o build_stt.
o current().
o data().
o die_on_loop().
o id().
o log().
o logger().
o match().
o report().
o start().
o validate().
o verbose().
- Set::FA got a fresh paint job, too, but since it's parent is Set::Object, Hash::FieldHash was not
used.
- Rewrite the documentation.
- Add Build.PL.
- Clean up Makefile.PL.
