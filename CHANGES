Revision history for Perl extension DFA::Command.

1.03  Sun May 29 12:52:00 2011
	  - Add next state to the output of report().

1.02  Sun May 29 12:35:00 2011
	  - Fix bug in Set::FA::Element.report(). Code called $self -> logger($level => $message)
	  	instead of $self -> logger -> log($level => $message).

1.01  Sun May 29 11:17:00 2011
	  - Add Mark Rogaski's name to the Author section, not just the Credit section, of each POD.
	  - Change Set::FA::Element's report() to output at log level info, rather than debug.
	  	The first line of output, 'Entered report()', is still at level debug, the same as all
		other method entry messages. It's just the body of the report at level info.
		This means you can now get the report without triggering all debug messages.
		Patch t/report.t to match.

1.00  Tue May 24 14:02:00 2011
	  - Co-maint is now with Ron Savage, who will do all future development, starting with this version.
	  - Rewrite Set::FA::Element to use getters/setters via Hash::FieldHash, rather than use direct
	  	access to the underlying hash.
	  - Change some parameters to Set::FA::Element.new(). See docs for details:
	  	o accept is now called accepting, since accept() is a method.
		o die_on_loop is a new option.
		o logger is a log object of some sort. I prefer Log::Handler. Log::Agent is not supported.
		o start is a new option.
		o states is not supported. The list of states in the transitions parameter is used instead.
		o Add (within the code) parentheses to the regexp parameter in the transitions option, if
		  it's not a coderef, to support the match() method.
		o verbose is a new option.
	  - New methods for Set::FA::Element:
	  	o build_stt.
	  	o current().
		o data().
	  	o die_on_loop().
		o id().
		o log().
		o logger().
		o match().
		o report().
		o start().
		o validate().
		o verbose().
	  - Set::FA got a fresh paint job, too, but since it's parent is Set::Object, Hash::FieldHash was not
	  	used.
	  - Rewrite the documentation.
	  - Add Build.PL.
	  - Clean up Makefile.PL.

0.101 Fri Mar 22 12:00:00 2002
	  - Added unified representation for transition rules.
	  - Rewrote clone() with a recursive deep copy.

0.100 Mon Mar 18 12:00:00 2002
	  - Initial release.
