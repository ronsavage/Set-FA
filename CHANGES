Revision history for Perl extension DFA::Command.

1.00  Tue May 24 14:02:00 2011
	  - Co-maint is now with Ron Savage, who will do all/any future development.
	  - Rewrite Set::FA::Element to use getters/setters via Hash::FieldHash, rather than direct
	  	access to the underlying hash.
	  - Change some parameters to new():
	  	o accept is now accepting, since accept() is a method.
		o die_on_loop is a new option.
		o logger is a log object of some sort. I prefer Log::Handler. Log::Agent is not supported.
		o start is a new option.
		o states is not supported. The list of states in the transitions parameter is used instead.
		o verbose is a new option.
	  - Rewrite the documentation.
